👁 RetinaFace — Deep Learning Face Detection

This project implements RetinaFace, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for face detection and landmark localization using TensorFlow and NumPy. It can detect faces, extract facial regions, and identify key landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth) with high accuracy. The model supports GPU acceleration, alignment, and automatic image preprocessing.
